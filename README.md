# Basket

Python implementation of a product basket (cart) functionality. it adds widgets to the basket, calculates the final amount after applying offer and delivery fees.


## Getting Started and local Installation 

- This project was written using python 3.8+
- Clone the repository & `cd basket`
- Run `python basket.py`

## Working and Assumptions
- A basic object-oriented implementation loads up product detail and delivery rules to memory from stored json and calculates the basket total value after applying offer and delivery fees.  
- The logic assumes that for every red widget that gets added to the basket, the second one's price gets halved. 
- Input as product code for the script is part of the solution and the solution does not ask the user for input.
